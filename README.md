##Let’s Quiz, 
The Online Quiz System 

Project Synopsis:
Let’s Quiz, The Online Quiz System is created using PHP, CSS, HTML and other web scripting language. The quiz system will have Login page for authentication and both teacher and student can use the platform. Core idea is to create a free platform on which teachers can create quiz and student can answer them remotely. This useful will be very useful as this let teacher to view report of the student after the quiz. It has database which keeps all the details of users using it and scores of the student. Using the Azure Cloud Services will reduce the cost of hosting and managing the website. Also user will require only internet and Computer to access. Azure Cloud Services will also be helpful to scale the resources as per the future need.

As we all know education is being digitalising all over the world. Here I present an idea of quiz website which can be used by Learners and Teachers. A Simple Online Quiz System which helps Teacher to add, manage and design the quizzes for the student/learner. Learner can take Quiz via this system. Both learner and teacher are authenticated on this system by login method.
